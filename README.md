# ESTNib
Easy Nib instantiation in Storyboards

This repository is forked from `meetearnest/ESTNib`.

# Usage
1) Add UIView+ESTNib to your project.

2) Give your Nibs the same file names as your UIView subclasses.
i.e. **MyView.swift** & **MyView.nib**

3) Drag a UIView object into your view controller

4) Set the UIView custom class to your subclass
